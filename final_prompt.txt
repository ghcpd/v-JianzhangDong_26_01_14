You are a senior frontend engineer. Generate a complete Personal Task Management Dashboard application with all files, tests, and startup scripts, then execute the tests and start the application.

## Role & Objective
Create a fully functional React-based Task Management Dashboard with automated testing, documentation, and Windows startup scripts. After generation, automatically run tests and start the development server.

## Real-World Use Case
Personal Task Management Dashboard for daily to-do tasks with the ability to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks, and visualize task statistics.

## Functional Requirements
Implement the following 5 features:
1. Add a new task with title, description, and due date
2. Edit an existing task's details (title, description, due date)
3. Mark a task as completed or pending
4. Delete a task
5. Display a summary dashboard showing total tasks, completed tasks, and pending tasks with visual charts

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- Programming language: JavaScript (React)
- Testing framework: Jest (or Cypress/Playwright)
- Chart library: Chart.js or similar for data visualization

### UI/UX Design
- Style: Modern minimalistic design
- Color scheme: Light blue and white color tone
- Layout: Clean, visually appealing, responsive
- Visual hierarchy: Clear and well-defined
- Alignment: Precise and consistent
- Documentation: Include detailed comments about fonts, colors, spacing, and layout decisions for UI aesthetics evaluation

## Step-by-Step Implementation Instructions

### 1. Create Project Configuration
- Generate `package.json` with all necessary dependencies (react, react-dom, chart.js, react-chartjs-2, testing-library, jest)
- Include scripts for start, test, build

### 2. Create HTML Template
- Generate `public/index.html` with proper meta tags
- Include Google Fonts for typography
- Set up root div for React mounting

### 3. Implement React Components

#### Core Application Files
- `src/index.js`: React entry point with root rendering
- `src/index.css`: Global styles with CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography
- `src/App.js`: Main component with state management for tasks, filter logic, and CRUD operations
- `src/App.css`: Main application layout styles

#### Component Files (with comprehensive CSS)
- `Header.js/css`: Application header with gradient design and title
- `Dashboard.js/css`: Statistics cards and Chart.js doughnut/pie chart visualization
- `TaskForm.js/css`: Form component for adding/editing tasks with validation
- `TaskList.js/css`: Task display with filter buttons (All/Pending/Completed) and task cards
- `Modal.js/css`: Reusable modal dialog with overlay and animations

#### CSS Requirements for All Components
- Detailed comments explaining font choices (family, size, weight)
- Color palette documentation (primary, secondary, accent, background)
- Spacing system documentation (margins, paddings, gaps)
- Layout strategy notes (flexbox/grid usage, alignment decisions)
- Responsive breakpoints (mobile: 480px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px)
- Animation/transition details

### 4. Create Automated Test Suite
Generate `test/auto_test.js` with comprehensive test coverage:

#### Test Categories (minimum 25+ tests)
- **Feature 1 Tests (7 tests)**: Add task with valid inputs, validate required fields, test title validation, description validation, due date validation, verify task appears in list, verify stats update
- **Feature 2 Tests (4 tests)**: Edit existing task, update all fields, verify changes persist, cancel edit
- **Feature 3 Tests (3 tests)**: Mark task as completed, toggle back to pending, verify stats update
- **Feature 4 Tests (3 tests)**: Delete task, verify removal from list, verify stats update
- **Feature 5 Tests (5 tests)**: Display total tasks count, display completed count, display pending count, render chart component, verify calculations
- **Filter Tests (3 tests)**: Filter all tasks, filter pending only, filter completed only
- **UI/UX Tests (3 tests)**: Modal open/close, form validation messages, responsive design elements

#### Test Configuration
- Use Jest with React Testing Library
- Include `setupTests.js` for test environment configuration
- Mock Chart.js components to avoid canvas rendering issues in JSDOM
- Create mocks in `src/__mocks__/` directory for chart.js and react-chartjs-2

#### Test Output
- Automatically create `logs/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Write detailed test results to `logs/test_run.log`
- Include timestamps, test names, pass/fail status, and error details
- Format output for easy readability

### 5. Create Windows Startup Script
Generate `start.bat` with the following functionality:
- Check if node_modules exists, run `npm install` if needed
- Execute `npm start` to launch development server
- Automatically open http://localhost:3000 in default browser
- Display clear status messages during startup
- Handle errors gracefully with informative messages

### 6. Create Test Execution Script
Generate `run_tests.bat` with:
- Create logs directory if missing
- Run npm test with verbose output
- Pipe results to `logs/test_run.log`
- Display results in console simultaneously

### 7. Create Documentation
Generate `README.md` with complete sections:
- Project overview and use case description
- Features list with implementation details for each of the 5 features
- Technology stack explanation
- Directory structure overview
- Installation instructions (if dependencies need manual setup)
- How to run the application using `start.bat`
- How to execute tests using `run_tests.bat` or npm test
- UI design documentation (colors, fonts, layout strategy)
- Browser compatibility notes
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Code Quality Standards
- Clean, readable code with intuitive naming conventions
- Comprehensive comments explaining logic, especially for:
  - State management decisions
  - Event handlers
  - Validation logic
  - CSS design choices (fonts, colors, spacing, alignment)
- Proper component decomposition
- DRY principles applied
- Error handling for edge cases

## Output Specification
All files must be created in the current working directory with the exact structure specified above. Files should be production-ready and immediately executable.

## Execution Workflow
After generating all files:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run automated tests: Execute `npm test` with output to `logs/test_run.log`
3. Start development server: Execute `npm start`
4. Open browser to http://localhost:3000

## Quality Gates
Before considering the task complete:
- All 5 features are fully implemented and functional
- All test files pass without errors (minimum 25+ tests passing)
- Application starts successfully and displays in browser
- UI is visually polished with documented design decisions
- README.md provides clear, complete instructions
- Test logs are generated successfully in logs/test_run.log
- start.bat and run_tests.bat execute without errors on Windows

## Constraints
- Target platform: Windows
- Browser: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- No external API dependencies
- Local storage for data persistence (optional but recommended)
- Must work with default Create React App configuration
- All dependencies must be installable via npm
- No manual configuration steps beyond running start.bat

## Critical Implementation Notes
- Ensure Chart.js is properly mocked in tests to avoid canvas rendering errors in JSDOM
- Use React Testing Library best practices (queries, user-events, waitFor)
- Implement proper form validation with user feedback
- Handle empty states gracefully (no tasks, no completed tasks, etc.)
- Ensure responsive design works on mobile devices (< 480px width)
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Include proper key props for list rendering

Execute all steps completely in a single session. Do not ask for confirmation or additional input. Generate all files, run tests, and start the application.
