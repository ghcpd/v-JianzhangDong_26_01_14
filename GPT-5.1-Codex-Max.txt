User: You are a senior frontend engineer. Please generate a complete UI Case sample according to the following requirements:

1. Real-world Use Case: Personal Task Management Dashboard for daily to-do tasks, with the ability to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks, and visualize task statistics.

2. Functional Requirements: Implement the following 5 features:
   1. Add a new task with title, description, and due date.
   2. Edit an existing task's details (title, description, due date).
   3. Mark a task as completed or pending.
   4. Delete a task.
   5. Display a summary dashboard showing total tasks, completed tasks, and pending tasks with visual charts.

3. Technical Requirements:
   - Programming language: JavaScript (React)
   - Page style: Modern minimalistic style
   - Layout should be clean and visually appealing, with an overall color tone of light blue and white.
   - UI should be aesthetically pleasing, well-aligned, responsive, with clear visual hierarchy.
   - Include comments or documentation about fonts, colors, spacing, and layout for easier UI aesthetics evaluation.

4. Automated Testing:
   - Generate a `test/auto_test.js` file using a JavaScript testing framework (e.g., Jest, Cypress, or Playwright).
   - The test should cover all 5 features and include normal inputs and edge cases.
   - Test results should be written to `logs/test_run.log`. If the `logs/` directory does not exist, create it automatically.
   - Output clear, self-explanatory logs.

5. Startup Script:
   - Generate a `start.bat` file that can start the project on Windows with a single click or command and automatically open the default browser to view the page.
   - Ensure the startup process is simple, with no hidden dependencies or complex configuration.

6. Documentation:
   - Generate a `README.md` file containing:
     - Project overview and real-world use case.
     - List of features and explanation of how each feature is implemented.
     - Instructions on how to run `start.bat` to view the UI.
     - Instructions on how to run `auto_test.js` to execute automated tests.
     - Any dependency installation or environment requirements (if applicable).
   - Documentation should be clear and easy to follow so anyone can replicate the setup.

7. Additional Requirements:
   - Code should be clean, with intuitive naming and complete comments.
   - UI output and test logs should be self-explanatory.
   - Use a clear project structure.

- Built a React-based personal task dashboard with add/edit/toggle/delete plus live stats and progress visuals in index.html and app.jsx, styled with documented tokens in style.css. Included lightweight static server server.js and one-click Windows launcher start.bat.
- Added Playwright automation covering validation, CRUD, status toggling, deletion, and summary consistency, writing logs to logs/test_run.log via auto_test.js. Project metadata lives in package.json. Usage, setup, and design notes captured in README.md.

Next steps:
1) Run `npm install` to fetch Playwright.  
2) Start UI via start.bat (or `node server.js` then open http://localhost:3000).  
3) Run tests with `npm test` and review logs/test_run.log.

Made changes.

User: do all these things

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: npm install

Ran terminal command: npm test

Ran terminal command: npx playwright install chromium

Ran terminal command: npm test

All tasks done:
- Installed dependencies and Playwright browsers.
- Ran automated tests; all passed. Logs are in test_run.log.

You can launch the UI with start.bat or `node server.js` → open http://localhost:3000.

User: start it

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: start.bat

Ran terminal command: .\start.bat

Task dashboard server started via start.bat. A browser window should be open at http://localhost:3000; you can interact with the UI there. If you need me to stop it later, let me know.
